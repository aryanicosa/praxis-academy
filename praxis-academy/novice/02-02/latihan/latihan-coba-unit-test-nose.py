'''
nose is compatible with any tests written using the unittest framework and 
can be used as a drop-in replacement for the unittest test runner. 
The development of nose as an open-source application fell behind, 
and a fork called nose2 was created. If youâ€™re starting from scratch, 
it is recommended that you use nose2 instead of nose.

To get started with nose2, install nose2 from PyPI and execute it on the command
line. nose2 will try to discover all test scripts named test*.py and
 test cases inheriting from unittest.TestCase in your current directory:

$ pip install nose2
$ python -m nose2
